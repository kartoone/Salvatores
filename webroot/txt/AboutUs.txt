Salvatore followed in his father's footsteps when he chose to be a chef.  Salvatore's dad, Vincenzo, emigrated to NY City from Naples, Italy in 1930, and worked as a chef in the famed Vesuvius Italian restaurant in mid-Manhattan.
 
Through the 50's, 60's and 70's, Vincenzo had restaurants in NY City and upstate NY. In the 70's, Salvatore worked with his dad and learned his craft. His meticulous  care in food preparation and use of the finest ingredients is self-evident in his dishes.
 
His food is consistently delicious.  All the sauces are home made by Salvatore as are the other foods served. They bring back the aromas and tastes of an era long past, remembered by some and seldom found elsewhere.
